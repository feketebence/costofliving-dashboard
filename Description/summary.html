            <h1>Summary of the Project</h1>
            <div class="descriptions">
                <h2>Map</h2>
                <p>   The map visualization of our dashboard projects the whole world, with around 580 cities added, which are presented as
                circles on the map. Hovering over these circles will individually show some information. More concretely the name of the
                city, the country in which this city can be found, and a certain Cost of Living Index. The mentioned Index reflects 
                the situation of the cities, with a number between 0 and in some cases over 100. 
                All these numbers are compared to New York City, which has a COL index of 100.
                The colors of the circles are based on the value of the index.
                What had to be done in order to get the exact coordinates of all the cities was to geocode the locations with the help
                of the Google Cloud service, but in order to get locations, we needed to have the data ready. We did a little
                web scraping from the numbeo.com website, which is highly recommended, in our opinion, for these kind of purposes.
                We got the data, so we could geocode the locations, after which we have created the visualization with the help of the
                D3 javascript library.
                </p>
                <h2>Chord</h2>
                <p>   This visualization requires a special kind of data set to be able to work with in D3. It works with a square matrix,
                    in which the data is stored. But let us begin with the visualization. First there is a certain number of categories.
                    Each one has a name, in this case the name is a continent or a bigger part of the world. Every category has a different
                    color. This visualization is showing us the connection between these entities. In this particular case we can see the
                    number of people from a certain part of the world, who have moved to the other parts, and vice versa.
                    If we were to hover over a category, which are represented by the arcs of the circle, then only the chords belonging to
                    this category are shown. And if we hover over a chord, then only this chord will be fully visible, and the rest is going
                    to fade away a bit. A click on the chord will show information, for example X people from Europe to Africa and Y people
                    from Africa to Europe. Simple as that. We found the data on a statistical and news website, called qz.com.
                </p>
                <h2>Column Chart</h2>
                <p>Our column chart is one of the more traditional visualizations that we have created in our project. Although, what is not to be considered
                    traditional is that there is not only one possible outcome for the chart, but around 5800, as we have mentioned before we have processed over
                    580 cities, and we have 10 categories. Each city combined with each category will result in a different outcome, because of the data, on which
                    the visualization is based on. We have gathered the data by scraping the page numbeo.com, where prices of cities, considering different
                    viewpoints, were listed. In the perspective of usefulness, by projecting the same category for different cities, we can easily compare them,
                    not only by examining the bars, but by hovering over them, in which case the exact price of the selected item from that category will be shown.
                    For instance let's say that the user selects the city Madrid and the category Utilities, the visualization will project the Basic and Internet
                    items, by hovering over them, the exact price will turn visible for the user. By following the same procedure but with another city, comparing
                    these is going to be simple.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe of one the oldest visualization type would be the scatter plot. It is a mathematical diagram that uses Cartesian coordinates in order to
                    be able to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. The pattern of the resulting points reveals any correlation present.
                    In our case the two variables will be two items from a category. We are going to need to select the two items, which we want to project as the
                    previously mentioned variables. A category in this case is the same as in the previous one. This time we don't need to select a city, because
                    the data will plotted for all of the cities. Hovering over a datapoint, the City, the two selected items, and the values for each of them will 
                    turn visible. When the user would like to update the plot with other data, then all there is to do would be to reselect the category and the two 
                    items. The scatter plot will automatically change its points. The data originates from the same numbeo.com.
